						<p class="subtitle"> Introduction</p>
						<p class="Text">As I'm sure many of you are aware, sporting events such as the Olympic Games have been widely televised for a number of years and spectators are often used to seeing large arrays of camera equipment to film the action. However, some fans may have noticed that at the most recent Olympics held in Tokyo there were a few extra cameras, five to be specific. These five extra cameras were used as part of a detailed 3-D tracking system that supplies 'near-instantaneous insights' into the athletes performance.</p>
						
						<p class="Text">Although, tracking isn't the only thing that this system is capable of. The technology used within the Tokyo Olympics suggests that the future of elite athletic training may revolve around using the data collected to create digital replicas of athletes, allowing teams to run computer modelled scenarios to decide what approach will be best to use in a particular event.</p>

					<div class="col-8">
						<p class="subtitle">How does it work?</p>
						<p class="Text">The 3-D tracking system used in Tokyo is an Intel product called 3DAT (3-D Athlete Tracking), an AI based computer vision software that tracks the movement of athletes without the need for on-body sensors. 3DAT works by feeding live footage from the track straight into a cloud based server. From here an AI program uses deep learning to analyse an athletes movements, highlighting key performance characteristics such as, top speed and deceleration. The system then shares the information it has gathered by displaying slow-motion graphic representations of the action. The time taken from capturing the live footage of the athletes to displaying the data collected takes less than thirty seconds.  </p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12">
						<p class="Text">A good example of how the system works can be demonstrated when it was used in the 2020 U.S. Olympic Track & Field Team Trials at Hayward Field on June 27, 2021 in Eugene, Oregon. Sha'Carri Richardson (pictured above) was tracked by 3DAT during the 100m trials and the AI was able to calculate her top speed to be 24.1 miles per hour, and her speed across the finish line was 20 miles per hour. In contrast, the runner in second place reached a top speed of 23.2 miles per hour and crossed the finish line at a speed of 20.4 miles per hour. This data allows Richardson to be able to compare her performance to the other athletes in her field as well as being able to see how she matches up against data from previous events.</p>

						<p class="Text">A quote from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanklee/" target="_blank" title="A link to Jonathon Lee's LinkedIn page">Jonathan Lee</a> (below), director of sports performance technology in the Olympic technology group at Intel:</p>

					<div class="col-10">
						<p class="subtitle">  ‚ÄúIt's like having your own personal commentator point things out to you in the race,‚Äù</p>
					</div>

					<div class="col-12">

						<p class="subtitle">How was the system created?</p>
						
						<p class="Text">As you can probably imagine creating an AI program this complex wasn't easy and took a lot of time, the most time consuming element being the training of the AI. In order to train the AI via machine learning, Lee and his team at Intel needed to record as much footage of elite athletes, specifically track and field athletes, in motion as possible. For their AI to be successful the team needed recordings of athletes performing very specific moves, this is due to the unique nature of particular events whereby pre-existing footage gathered in similar research isn't sufficient. One sport that Lee mentions in particular is the High Jump saying that; "People aren't usually fully horizontal seven feet in the air,‚Äù he notes, but world-class high jumpers reach such heights regularly, and so the AI needed to be trained on these scenarios.</p>
						<p class="Text">After all of the footage had been collected a team at Intel was tasked with manually annotating every part of the body, pixel by pixel! Despite this painstaking and time consuming challenge, the team were able to complete it allowing the model to get to work. Initially the model began by connecting the highlighted points in three dimensions, then it used this to create a simplified rendering of an athlete's form in a 'skelton' like structure. This skeleton can then be used to perform a process called 3-D pose estimation (a computer vision technique that tracks an object and tries to predict the changes it may undergo in space) on an athlete's body during an event.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="col-6">

						<p class="subtitle">What is a digital twin?</p>
						<p class="Text">As I mentioned previously, it is thought that the future of athletic training may revolve around a digital replica of an athlete, more commonly referred to as a digital twin. Readers interested in video games (particularly racing games) may be able to liken a digital twin to a 'ghost record', and they are similar only a digital twin is much more complex. A digital twin is a model that exists within a computer program and can be viewed on screen or often in virtual reality, they can then be used to run through simulations of real-world scenarios and provide data on the expected performance of the physical element the model is replicating. The phrase 'digital twin' was coined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-vickers-0b794111/" target="_blank" title="A link to John Vickers's LinkedIn page">John Vickers</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-grieves-6165719/" target="_blank" title="A link to Michael Grieves' LinkedIn page">Michael Grieves</a> three decades after the original concept was introduced around 1970 during the Apollo 13 mission. The use of digital twins within sport could be amazingly beneficial to athletes as it could eventually allow them to make predictions about their future real-world performance to a high degree of accuracy. </p>

						<p class="subtitle">Conclusion</p>
						<p class="Text">In the page above I have discussed a small portion of the uses for AI based tracking systems within elite sport, however regarding the further implementation of this technology, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barricelli/" target="_blank" title="A link to Barbara Rita Barricelli's LinkedIn page">Barbara Rita Barricelli</a> believes that similar technology to that which was used in Tokyo could become standard in a variety of sports through the use of wearable fitness monitors and smaller AI camera arrays. Jonathan Lee also thinks that his AI system could be used in other applications such as by the 'average gym-goer'. The introduction of this technology into everyday life may never happen due to it's complexity and expense however, it would provide amateur athletes and the regular person with previously unknown information about how sleep patterns and diet affects performance or provide advice on how to improve form to as to avoid injury. So to conclude, I believe that the introduction of tracking technology into elite sport will cause some issues however, on the whole I think that it will have many positive outcomes for both fans and athletes that allow for them to see past, present and potentially future performances. With reference to using this technology in other types of sporting activity, I think that despite the number of benefits it would offer, we currently lack the technological equipment to be able to implement such complex technology into our every day lives.</p>
