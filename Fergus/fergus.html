          <p class="subtitle">Background</p>
          <p class="Text">
            According to the 
            <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/research/safe-surgery">
            World Health Organization</a>,
            of the many millions of people who undergo surgical treatment, 25% of patients experience surgical complications,
            with the crude mortality rate of 0.5-5%. 
          </p>
          <p class="Text">Although according to 
            <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-doctor-ai-surgery-1.6293860">Ryan Patrick Jones/CBC News</a>,
            actions taken by surgeons are not the sole cause of these surgical complications, it is still one of the major 
            causes of these complications.
          </p> 
          <p class="Text">Dr. Armin Madani, a general surgeon with the Sprott Department of Surgery at 
            the University Health Network(UHN) in Toronto wants to reduce this risk.
          </p>
          <p class="Text">
            When he was researching the techniques and thought processes adopted by world-class surgeons, 
            a group of data and computer scientists proposed using Artificial intelligence (AI) to mimic their minds.
          </p>
          <p class="Text">
            The product of the collaboration is a prototype, created by analyzing hours of gallbladder surgeries footages 
            with the annotation from experts for where they would dissect. The algorithm starts to recgonize patterns 
            and develops the ability to identify whether an organ is safe to dissect or not in real time. 
          </p>
          <p class="Text">
            The result is an algorithm with a 93-95% accuracy in recgonizing safe and dangerous areasa in the liver, 
            gallbladder and hepatocystic triangle, according to 
            <a href="https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Citation/2022/08000/Artificial_Intelligence_for_Intraoperative.22.aspx">Annals of Surgery</a>.

            Application
          </p>
          <p class="Text">
            Using gallbladder surgery as an example, "keyhole incisions" are made around the patient's belly area, 
            with a camera inserted into the abdomen and specialized tools are used to cut away and remove the organ.
          </p>
          <p class="Text">
            During the operation, the technology can either colour areas onto the monitor to show whether the area is safe to cut,
            or it can use a heatmap-style to show the level of confidence of the safe area.

          <p class="subtitle">Potential</p>
          <p class="Text">
            Despite the technology is still in development, and having a limited scope of application, 
            currently only applicable for gallbladder surgeries. Madani believes that it has great potential
            to improve surgery around the world in the future, especially in areas lack surgery expertise. 
          </p>
          <p class="Text">
            Dr. Daniel Hashimoto, a surgery instructor at University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, 
            who collaborated with Madani on the study, stated that the real promise of the technology is the ability to assist surgeons 
            in understanding what they are perceiving during an operation better, acting as a second pair of eyes in the operation room.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">Challenges</p>
          <p class="Text">
            One of the challenges is the uncertainty of the effectiveness of the technology in enhancing performance. 
            While the prototype is working properly, it is uncertain if the application of this technology will improve the performance of 
            surgeons and reduce surgical complications. According to Hashimoto, the only way to answer this question is through clinical trial 
            studying adverse event, however, these event requires a large number of patient willing to volunteer, hence difficult to conduct.
          </p>
          <p class="Text">
            Another challenge the technology faces is the data required for training. According to Frank Rudzicz, a computer science professor 
            at the University of Toronto, who is an expert in the application of Artificial Intelligence in health care, modern machine learning
            is highly dependent on data. In a common operation like gallbladder surgery, which is the most common operation, it is relatively easy 
            to obtain a large amount of footage of successful surgeries. For less common surgeries, the difficulty for the researcher to 
            obtain useful videos will increase significantly.
          </p>
          <p class="Text">
            The technology also faces the problem of it being a possible distraction for surgeons, according to Rudzicz. This is because 
            surgeons need to be highly aware of their patients and their surroundings, with the application of this technology, surgeons' ability
            to observe their surroundings and their patients might be impacted negatively.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle">Conclusion</p>
          <p class="Text">
            While other experts say there are still many challenges to conquer, they do agree with the potential of the technology. And Madani has 
            plans to overcome these challenges.
          </p>
          <p class="Text">
            To tackle the challenge of insufficient data, Madani is in discussion with other experts on the possibility of creating a global repository 
            for surgical videos, which reduces the difficulty for the researcher to search for appropriate data for model training.
          </p>
          <p class="Text">
            For the challenge of uncertainty in the effectiveness, the prototype has been tested in live surgery 
            to make sure it works properly, and now seeking approval from the UHN's ethics board to conduct further 
            research on whether the technology improves performance of other surgeons, reducing negative surgical complications.
