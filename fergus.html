                            a group of data and computer scientists proposed using Artificial intelligence (AI) to mimic their minds.

                    <p class="Text">
                        Despite the technology is still in development, and having a limited scope of application, 
                        currently only applicable for gallbladder surgeries. Madani believes that it has great potential
                        to improve surgery around the world in the future, especially in areas lack surgery expertise. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="Text">
                        Dr. Daniel Hashimoto, a surgery instructor at University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, 
                        who collaborated with Madani on the study, stated that the real promise of the technology is the ability to assist surgeons 
                        in understanding what they are perceiving during an operation better, acting as a second pair of eyes in the operation room.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subtitle">Challenges</p>
                    <p class="Text">
                        One of the challenges is the uncertainty of the effectiveness of the technology in enhancing performance. 
                        While the prototype is working properly, it is uncertain if the application of this technology will improve the performance of 
                        surgeons and reduce surgical complications. According to Hashimoto, the only way to answer this question is through clinical trial 
                        studying adverse event, however, these event requires a large number of patient willing to volunteer, hence difficult to conduct.
                    </p>
                    <p class="Text">
                        Another challenge the technology faces is the data required for training. According to Frank Rudzicz, a computer science professor 
                        at the University of Toronto, who is an expert in the application of Artificial Intelligence in health care, modern machine learning
                        is highly dependent on data. In a common operation like gallbladder surgery, which is the most common operation, it is relatively easy 
                        to obtain a large amount of footage of successful surgeries. For less common surgeries, the difficulty for the researcher to 
                        obtain useful videos will increase significantly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="Text">
                        The technology also faces the problem of it being a possible distraction for surgeons, according to Rudzicz. This is because 
                        surgeons need to be highly aware of their patients and their surroundings, with the application of this technology, surgeons' ability
                        to observe their surroundings and their patients might be impacted negatively.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subtitle">Conclusion</p>
                    <p class="Text">
                        While other experts say there are still many challenges to conquer, they do agree with the potential of the technology. And Madani has 
                        plans to overcome these challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p class="Text">
                        To tackle the challenge of insufficient data, Madani is in discussion with other experts on the possibility of creating a global repository 
                        for surgical videos, which reduces the difficulty for the researcher to search for appropriate data for model training.
                    </p>
                    <p class="Text">
                        For the challenge of uncertainty in the effectiveness, the prototype has been tested in live surgery 
                        to make sure it works properly, and now seeking approval from the UHN's ethics board to conduct further 
                        research on whether the technology improves performance of other surgeons, reducing negative surgical complications.
