						<p class="subtitle"> Introduction</p>
						<p class="Text">As I'm sure many of you are aware, sporting events such as the Olympic Games have been widely televised for a number of years and spectators are often used to seeing large arrays of camera equipment to film the action. However, some fans may have noticed that at the most recent Olympics held in Tokyo there were a few extra cameras, five to be specific. These five extra cameras were used as part of a detailed 3-D tracking system that supplies 'near-instantaneous insights' into the athletes performance.</p>
						
						<p class="Text">Although, tracking isn't the only thing that this system is capable of. The technology used within the Tokyo Olympics suggests that the future of elite athletic training may revolve around using the data collected to create digital replicas of athletes, allowing teams to run computer modelled scenarios to decide what approach will be best to use in a particular event.</p>

						<p class="subtitle">How does it work?</p>
						<p class="Text">The 3-D tracking system used in Tokyo is an Intel product called 3DAT (3-D Athlete Tracking), an AI based computer vision software that tracks the movement of athletes without the need for on-body sensors. 3DAT works by feeding live footage from the track straight into a cloud based server. From here an AI program uses deep learning to analyse an athletes movements, highlighting key performance characteristics such as, top speed and deceleration. The system then shares the information it has gathered by displaying slow-motion graphic representations of the action. The time taken from capturing the live footage of the athletes to displaying the data collected takes less than thirty seconds.  </p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12">
						<p class="Text">A good example of how the system works can be demonstrated when it was used in the 2020 U.S. Olympic Track & Field Team Trials at Hayward Field on June 27, 2021 in Eugene, Oregon. Sha'Carri Richardson (pictured above) was tracked by 3DAT during the 100m trials and the AI was able to calculate her top speed to be 24.1 miles per hour, and her speed across the finish line was 20 miles per hour. In contrast, the runner in second place reached a top speed of 23.2 miles per hour and crossed the finish line at a speed of 20.4 miles per hour. This data allows Richardson to be able to compare her performance to the other athletes in her field as well as being able to see how she matches up against data from previous events.</p>
