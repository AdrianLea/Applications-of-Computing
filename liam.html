						<p class="subtitle">Introduction</p>
						<p class="Text">Cloud computing is a rather extensive topic in computation application. On a basic level, it opens a vast number of opportunities for sharing a range of resources and hardware. These resources are accessible from a local machine which comes with many benefits both to individuals and businesses.</p>
						<p class="Text">The ability to store data remotely can save money, resources and power for a business. Particularly with the energy crisis, this may be a solution for smaller businesses to save money and work more efficiently than previous methods.</p>

						<p class="subtitle">What is The Cloud?</p>
						<p class="Text">The cloud is a term used to describe a large network of different servers. These servers may share the same functionality, or each have their own. Microsoft‚Äôs description of the cloud is as follows: ‚ÄúThe cloud is not a physical entity, but instead a vast network of remote servers around the glove which are hooked together and meant to operation as a single ecosystem‚Äù (Azure Microsoft, 2022).</p>
						<br>
						<p class="Text">Microsoft also states that there are in total four specific types of clouds, each serving a specific purpose for different organizations:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Public Cloud</li>
							<li>Private Cloud</li>
							<li>Hybrid Cloud</li>
							<li>Community Cloud</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="Text">This video explains cloud computing in some more detail. It goes over the uses of clouds and some of the reasons why it is a better solution in specific situations:</p>

						<br>
						<p class="subtitle">Types of Clouds:</p>
						<p class="subtitle">Public Cloud:</p>
						<p class="Text">A public cloud is the network that publicly shares resources over the internet to the public. This is commonly used by individuals rather than businesses. The most common use of this cloud is cloud storage. The ability to store information remotely. There are many benefits from using cloud storage. By storing files on a server rather than locally, storage space is freed up, allowing for more storage on a personal device. Alternatively, this can be used to back up important files rather than investing in a second storage device such as a flash drive or an external hard disk drive.</p>
						<p class="subtitle">Private Cloud:</p>
						<p class="Text">A private cloud, as stated in the name is privately accessed. This is usually owned by a large organization or business. This is not readily available to the public and is usually only accessible within an organization‚Äôs intranet or extranet. This cloud tends to be significantly more secure than public cloud, since it can only be accessed by authorised devices or users. The functionality of a private cloud is usually for business purposes. This includes data storage, print servers, mail servers, backup and recovery.</p>
						<p class="subtitle">Hybrid Cloud:</p>
						<p class="Text">A hybrid cloud is a combination of the clouds above. It ‚Äúconsists of at least one public cloud, at least one private cloud and a hybrid cloud manager (HCM)‚Äù (Ubuntu, 2022). A research report from 2020 states it is the most popular cloud, with it being used by 62% of the IT industry. This allows for the movement of workloads on demand between the public and private cloud as and when required (IMB, 2022). This offers a level of privacy whilst still being publicly available as needed.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-6">
						<p class="subtitle">Community Cloud:</p>
						<p class="Text">A community cloud differs from the rest. It is used for as a ‚Äúforum‚Äù or ‚Äúcollaboration and communication‚Äù (Pexlify, 2022). There are other ways to implement collaboration however the community cloud offers integrity. This security can often be missed in other communication methods and this is what makes this type of cloud stand out.</p>

						<p class="subtitle">What are the uses of Clouds?</p>
						<p class="Text">The cloud has many uses. There are 7 which tend to be the most common. The table below goes over these and explains each of them:</p>
						<table>
							<tr>
								<th>Service</th>
								<th>Explanation</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Infastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)</td>
								<td>This is when the server shares processing, network and storage resources over the internet.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</td>
								<td>This is the same as IaaS but there is support from the organisation running the cloud.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</td>
								<td>A way of sharing software remotely. If an organisation has a licence to share software with it's members then this is a way of distributing it.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Testing and Development</td>
								<td>This is a method of remote development. This works great for large organisations that have lots of people working together at the same time.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Big data Analysis</td>
								<td>Some businesses collect lots and lots of data. This is all meaning less if it is not analyised. The processing of such large amounts of data can be very expensive and this is a way to use equipment designed for such processing without having to invest into it.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Cloud Storage</td>
								<td>Cloud storage is a method of storing data and information remotely in a secure environment. This means that less local storage is required and is a way of cutting costs.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Disaster Recovery and Data Backup</td>
								<td>Similar to cloud storage, this stores back up versions so should a system need resetting. Then the data and information can be downloaded to get it up and running again. This is used by both businesses and individuals.</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<p class="Text">The information collected in this table is from IBM (IBM, 2022).</p>
						<p class="subtitle">Are there any negatives?</p>
						<p class="Text">While is possible to create your own cloud, most likely a private cloud, they are very expensive to set up yourself. This means that someone else will be incontrol of them. They are often large data centres which can be a target for hackers as the reward for them would by high. Make sure to choose one that is very secure and protective of your data. On another note since they are in control, they are in control of the price they charge. This is also very likely to fluctuate and change. It could even get to the point where you are dependant on there service but if the price keeps increasing then may no longer be the more effective way of working.</p>
						<p class="subtitle">Conclusion</p>
						<p class="Text">The cloud has lots of great applications. It is a way to share resources and informtation with one another. A means of communications and collaboration. The ability to delegate processes to another machine make the local ones more efficient. This means the work load can be increased greatly. People have access to what they need, no matter where they are or what machine they are on (as long as they have an internet connection of course). This allows people all over to collaborate and work with one another, not being limited by their equipment. People can work from home, in a cafe or even in a holiday villa, allowing them to be more comfortable and therefore more productive. This method of communication has made a massively positive contribution to society and I am excited to see where it will go in the future.</p>
